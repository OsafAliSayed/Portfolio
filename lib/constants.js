    review: `
    I had the pleasure of working with Osaf, and I can confidently say he exceeded every expectation. He is extremely smart, curious, and consistently punctual. An absolute gem to work with.

    During our engagement, he contributed far beyond his role:

      Built complete test pipelines for both the frontend and backend from scratch, robust, clean, and reliable.

      Demonstrated deep understanding of asynchronous systems and implemented solutions 
      that were efficient and well-architected.

      Showed excellent backend engineering skills, especially in Django.
      
      Created automation scripts to streamline frontend workflows, including automated
      tag-adding tools that saved our team significant time.

      Writes excellent documentation. In fact, when he first joined us as an intern, 
      we tasked him with fixing the backend setup documentation (which had several issues, especially around PostgreSQL). 
      He handled it meticulously and improved the onboarding process for every future developer.

      He is proactive, communicates clearly, and brings a problem-solving mindset to every task. 
      Truly a standout engineer with a bright future ahead. I'd work with him again without hesitation.

      `I hired Osaf for a few small Django site updates, and he ended up improving much more than expected. 
      He proactively fixed layout and content issues, cleaned up templates, and modernized the site overall. 
      He worked in the CST timezone, which made communication smooth and quick. He delivers clean, professional 
      results without needing constant direction. Fast, responsive, and easy to work with - will definitely hire again.`,
