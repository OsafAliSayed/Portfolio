# How I Built My Personal Blog & Portfolio 

You might be reading this blog on my personal website, which also serves as my portfolio. I use this space to document what I’m building, the decisions I make, and the things I learn along the way as a freelancer.

In this article, I’ll walk through the architecture and implementation of my blog, with one key constraint:

**Everything had to be free, portable, and fully under my control.**

This blog is aimed at developers who want a zero-cost personal blog without relying on heavy CMS platforms or paid infrastructure.

## Goals & Requirements

Before writing any code, I defined a few non-negotiable requirements:

1. No paid services (no hosting bills, no subscriptions)
2. Content should live in my Git repository
3. Easy to migrate or rebuild anytime
4. Write blogs in Markdown
5. Track blog views to understand reach
6. Fast loading, SEO-friendly

In short: *I wanted a developer-first blog with full ownership.*

## System Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](/uploads/blog-system-architecture-diagram.png "System Architecture Diagram")

The entire system is designed around one core idea:

```
Everything starts and ends with Git.
```

There is no traditional backend, no database, and no runtime server logic. The whole blog is built and served as static files.

High-level Flow:

1. I write or edit blogs using Decap CMS.
2. Decap commits Markdown files directly to my GitHub repository.
3. A GitHub Action is triggered on every push.
4. The action runs a build step that generates static pages.
5. The built site is deployed to www.osafalisayed.com.

Users access the site as plain static HTML.

Markdown → Git → Build → Static Website → User

### Content Pipeline

Decap CMS is only responsible for one thing:
*creating Markdown files and pushing them to Git.*

There is:

* No external CMS backend
* No database
* No API calls

GitHub itself becomes my content store, version control system, and backup.

This makes migration trivial:

```
If Git exists, my entire blog exists.
```

### Build & Deployment

```yaml

name: Deploy Next.js site to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["master"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:

  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:

      - name: Build with Next.js
        run: ${{ steps.detect-package-manager.outputs.runner }} next build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Every push to the repository triggers a GitHub Action.

That action:

* Triggers the build process
* Generates static pages
* Outputs a fully built website
* Deploys it on Github Pages

This is pure Static Site Generation (SSG):

* No runtime rendering
* No cold starts
* No server load

The final output is just static files served to the user.

### Analytics & View Tracking

For tracking blog views, I use PostHog.

The flow is:

1. Users visit my website.
2. A lightweight PostHog script tracks page views.
3. Once a week, a GitHub Action pulls view stats.
4. These stats are used during the next build, which is triggered in the same workflow.

This keeps analytics:

* Completely decoupled from content
* Non-blocking for performance
* Invisible to the core system

### Why This Architecture Works So Well

This setup gives me:

1. Zero hosting cost
2. No backend maintenance
3. Full ownership of content
4. Instant page loads
5. No vendor lock-in

And most importantly:

**My blog is just files and code.**

Which means I can rebuild it anywhere, anytime.

## Content Management: Why Decap CMS

The first real decision was: How do I write my blogs?

Most CMS options fell into two categories:

1. Paid
2. free but locked into an ecosystem

Since I already write most of my notes in Markdown, I wanted something that:

1. Supports Markdown natively
2. Doesn’t require a separate backend
3. Can run locally

That’s why I chose Decap CMS.

It lets me:

- Write Markdown visually if I want
- Store everything directly in Git
- Keep my workflow simple

As I scale, I can even host Decap remotely and write from anywhere - but without changing my architecture.

## Why I Didn’t Use a Database

I considered options like Supabase and Firebase, but storing Markdown articles in a relational database felt wrong.

At my current stage:

- I don’t need real-time features
- I’m not tracking likes or comments
- I just need content + pages

A Git repo already gives me:

- Version history
- Backup
- Portability

So I kept it simple.

## Rendering Markdown with Static Site Generation

Once the content lives in Git, the next problem is:

```
How do I turn Markdown into real pages?
```

The solution is Static Site Generation (SSG).

During build time:

- The app reads all Markdown files
- Parses them using remark
- Enhances code blocks with **rehype-highlight**

Generates one static page per blog

This means:

- No server rendering
- No database queries
- No cold starts

Everything is pre-built and served as plain HTML.

This is done using the generateStaticParams method in Next.js:

```js

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const slugs = getAllPostSlugs();
  return slugs.map((slug) => ({
    slug: slug,
  }));
}
```
followed by a simple getAllPostSlugs function, which fetches all the post slugs based on file names from the content directory

```js

export function getAllPostSlugs() {
  try {
    ensurePostsDirectory();
    const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory);
    return fileNames
      .filter(name => name.endsWith('.md'))
      .map(name => name.replace(/\.md$/, ''));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading posts directory:', error);
    return [];
  }
}
```

Once you have all the content of a blog in markdown, you simply convert it into HTML using **remark** and finally render it by creating a **BlogContent** component. The entire purpose of this component is to basically make sure the right things are highlighted and styled properly based on your site design.

```jsx

'use client';

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

export default function BlogContent({ contentHtml }) {
  const contentRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (contentRef.current) {
      const preElements = contentRef.current.querySelectorAll('pre');

      preElements.forEach((pre) => {
        if (pre.querySelector('.copy-button-container')) return;

        pre.style.position = 'relative';
        pre.classList.add('group');
        // Ensure there's room at the top for the language badge (in case global CSS wasn't loaded yet)
        pre.style.paddingTop = pre.style.paddingTop || '1.25rem';

        const codeElement = pre.querySelector('code');

        // Ensure .hljs class is present so our CSS rules apply (rehype-highlight usually adds this)
        if (codeElement && !codeElement.classList.contains('hljs')) {
          codeElement.classList.add('hljs');
        }

        // Determine language from class (e.g. language-python)
        let lang = '';
        if (codeElement && codeElement.className) {
          const classes = codeElement.className.split(/\s+/);
          for (const c of classes) {
            if (c.startsWith('language-')) {
              lang = c.replace('language-', '');
              break;
            }
          }
        }

        // Language badge (left)
        if (lang) {
          const langBadge = document.createElement('span');
          langBadge.className = 'language-badge absolute top-[0.25rem] left-2 text-[10px] font-mono text-neutral-300 bg-white/5 px-1.5 rounded';
          langBadge.textContent = lang;
          pre.appendChild(langBadge);
        }

        // Copy button container (right)
        const buttonContainer = document.createElement('div');
        buttonContainer.className = 'copy-button-container absolute top-2 right-2 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity';

        const button = document.createElement('button');
        button.className = 'p-1.5 bg-white/10 hover:bg-white/20 border border-white/20 rounded text-neutral-300 hover:text-white transition-colors text-xs font-mono min-w-[44px] h-[28px] flex items-center justify-center';
        button.textContent = 'Copy';
        button.setAttribute('aria-label', 'Copy code');

        // Copy fresh code text on click (handles highlighted spans)
        button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
          try {
            const codeText = codeElement ? codeElement.textContent : pre.textContent;
            await navigator.clipboard.writeText(codeText);
            button.textContent = '✓';
            button.style.color = '#10b981';
            setTimeout(() => {
              button.textContent = 'Copy';
              button.style.color = '';
            }, 2000);
          } catch (err) {
            console.error('Failed to copy text: ', err);
          }
        });

        buttonContainer.appendChild(button);
        pre.appendChild(buttonContainer);
      });
    }
  }, [contentHtml]);

  return (
    <div 
      ref={contentRef}
      className="prose prose-sm dark:prose-invert max-w-none
        prose-headings:text-neutral-100 prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings: tracking-tighter
        prose-h2:text-2xl

        prose-td:text-neutral-300"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: contentHtml }}
    />
  );
}
```

Even though we are dangerously setting the HTML content here, we won't have to worry about XSS attacks because:

1. The content is rendered during build time and completely controlled by me not the users. 
2. There is no direct user input were user can just inject content and run it on the server.
3. There is a remark → rehype pipeline in */blog/[slug]/page.jsx* that makes sure that all HTML tags are escaped and are safe for rendering

## Limitations

This architecture serves my purpose fully however it does have its own limitations:

1. No real-time features: real-time features usually require a backend and a database support for this to work smoothly. It is definitely something that I can upgrade on in future.
2. Build time increases as content grows: As the number of articles increase the build time for my static site can increase alot. Until this happens I am sticking with this architecture only🤷‍♂️
3. No built-in analytics: I am unable to get reviews on the content of my blog as of now. This is something I will definitely add once I start getting lots of visiters daily.

## Monitoring & Reliability

One thing most personal sites ignore is monitoring.

There have been times when I opened my own site and saw a 404.
Which means it could’ve been down for hours without me knowing.

So I added Uptime Robot.

Now:

- My site is checked every few minutes
- I get alerts if it goes down
- There’s a public status page for users. You can view it [here](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/blyLUFFRJh).

If the site is ever unavailable, I can redirect users to the status page instead of showing a broken site.

## Final Thoughts

This blog is not just a website - it’s part of my learning system.

It helps me:

- Think more clearly
- Document decisions
- Build a public knowledge base
- Showcase how I approach engineering problems

The tech stack is simple.
The real value is owning the entire pipeline from idea → Markdown → deployed product.

And the best part?

I can nuke the whole thing tomorrow and rebuild it in an hour😂.
No lock-in. No dependencies. Just files and code.
