 I recently took a course from Hitesh Choudhary and Piyush Garg called ["Full stack generative and Agentic AI with python"](https://www.udemy.com/course/full-stack-ai-with-python/). I skipped most of the python portions as I already know those and jumped straight into AI section, I wanted to know how are these basic level queries made to AI. I am too lazy to go through documentation even though I know as I have started this project I will be jumping into ALOT of documentation and implementation details.

The course gave me a basic idea of how to make an API call to AI, chaining the AI calls using Langraph etc.

WIth the basic knowledge of AI, I was equipped to implement the most sophisticated piece of software the entire world has ever seen.

Without a second thought, I initialized a repository for **Noah:** an agentic AI that should be responsible for maintaining my local system.

AI has made me and everyone lazy so now I want to feel like freaking Iron man when I sit to work. Why should I do basic menial maintenance task and not give it to AI?? huhhhh??
